                <h3>Takumi and Keisuke of the gifted mountain racing team, Project D, face their toughest opponents yet as they race to conquer the Kanagawa area's finest racers and mountain roads. <br> <br>

                    With Keisuke defeating Go Hojo uphill, Takumi faces a young prodigy, Shinji who drives a very familiar car.</h3>

                <h1>Rating: 9/10</h1>

                <h4>Character development and depth have been severely lacking in Initial D since Second Stage. The story arc with Ryosuke in Fifth Stage covered some ground, but the anime characters failed to captivate. Understably, the manga incorporates a lot more details and character nuances into the story, whereas the anime has struggled to translate that into action.

                    Having said that, Final Stage gives viewers much-needed closure. To some extent, the ending was predictable. The final race was full of suspense and an unexpected sequence. As the action unfolded, the story did not provide much closure. The later stages have a genuine focus on racing, which is fantastic for fellow automotive enthusiasts.Final Stage will leave you wanting more from the standpoint of a fan. According to the ending credits sequence, there could have been another four to six episodes to really bring the series home.
                    
                    Final Stage, on the other hand, provides action-packed racing, moral quandaries on the road, and continues Project D's racing ethos of being street specialists who excel in a dogfight. Some familiar characters returned, and there was a passing of the torch from Takumi to Shinji. Their lack of face-to-face interaction at the end of the race was a moral letdown, but the evolution of Shinji's team made up for it. - Eyebols
